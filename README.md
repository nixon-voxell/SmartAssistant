# Smart Assistant

I have created a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncER2nHWTko&list=PLlnBGPe6GFdMxJwR8YXo_GfE1LtnTZfbk) for this project.

This project aims to create a fully functional smart assistant that is able to control your house and automate them. 
You can look at our plan at [Milanote](https://app.milanote.com/1KPrwu1FVZ7S2G?p=UGrY3QR3ztP).
To get more details on what Smart Assistant is, head to our [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VVpCAUW7GcWCcOrWAtEkXxx1AH59J9e59fqEaYfNGSw/edit?usp=sharing) and also our [Miro](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/N49aNY6BBYnq58GVk5gkTm2Vzg7k4OVYFuFsTSrVD7O4zjHOaLg5PMvg2Ut1rYHG) board for a visualization of the whole workflow and process.

Here is an overview of Smart Assistant.
